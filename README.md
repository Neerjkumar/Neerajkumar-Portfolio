A personal portfolio is an evidentiary document designed to provide qualitative and quantitative information.

Clients want to see your thought process and the ideas behind your designs. Our creative recruiters recommend that your portfolio include mood boards, color stories, silhouette and print ideas, hand and/or illustrator sketches as well as the final product shots.

A personal website or portfolio is an opportunity to reach more people with your work. It's also an extension of your personality and gives you the chance to craft a design that reflects who you are as a creative. Just as there are many types of creatives, there are many ways to put together a personal website.

I have created my portfolio using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and CSS.
HTML: HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
