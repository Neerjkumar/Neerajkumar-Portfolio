A personal portfolio is an evidentiary document designed to provide qualitative and quantitative information.

Clients want to see your thought process and the ideas behind your designs. Our creative recruiters recommend that your portfolio include mood boards, color stories, silhouette and print ideas, hand and/or illustrator sketches as well as the final product shots.

A personal website or portfolio is an opportunity to reach more people with your work. It's also an extension of your personality and gives you the chance to craft a design that reflects who you are as a creative. Just as there are many types of creatives, there are many ways to put together a personal website.

I have created my portfolio using [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) and [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp). <br>
[HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics): HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

[CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/First_steps): CSS is the language we use to style a Web page. CSS is used to style and lay out web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.
